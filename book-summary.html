        <h1 class="header">Themes Emerging From Chapter 1&2 Of Born A Crime
        </h1> <br>
        <p class="text">
            One of the themes emerging from Trevor Noah’s Born a Crime book is 
            religion. He sheds light on how religion played a key role in his 
            life. Since my life as a child this has also always been a rule at home
            , from when I was just a child church was always a must, and every time 
            we had the chance of hearing of a revival service in a church within our 
            neighborhood we were always front in line. Till this day even in my adulthood, 
            my friends with similar experiences, always sit and laugh 
            about how our parents still always order us to attend church services. This 
            is something I have personally experienced and also heard from people 
            Around me. <br><br>
            Another emerging theme is tribalism, whereby you find that the way we’ve been raised to relate with 
             people within our tribe more comfortably than those of others. Sometimes it 
             even reaches a point where some of us are not allowed to marry outside 
             our cultures and those who do undergo isolation from the community. <br> <br>
             Although such cases are reducing with time some people still choose to 
             have specific beliefs about other communities, especially with the rise of 
              many women taking up professions that were only believed to facilitate
               men.Those women end up being perceived as though they wouldn’t 
               possibly be able to do even half of the work men do in those professions 
               and that their place is at home taking care of the children and doing house 
                chores.
