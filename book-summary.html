        </h1> <br>
        <p class="text">
            One of the issues emerging from Trevor Noah’s “Born a Crime”, book is 
            religion. Trevor Noah sheds light on how religion played a key role in his <br>
            life, where I come from this has also always been one of the motors we 
            lived with, from when I was little church was always a must, and every time <br>
            we had the chance of hearing about a revival service in a church within our 
            neighborhood we were always front in line. Till today even in my adulthood <br>
            my friends who grew up together in the same area always sit and laugh 
            about how our parents still always order us to attend church services. This <br>
            is something I have personally experienced and also heard from people 
            Around me. <br>
            Another emerging issue that I can relate to from where I come from is 
            tribalism, whereby you find that the way we’ve been raised to relate with <br>
             people within our tribe more comfortably than those of others. Sometimes it 
             even reaches a point where some of us are not allowed to marry outside <br>
             our cultures and those who do undergo isolation from the community. <br> 
             Although such cases are reducing with time some people still choose to 
             have specific beliefs about other communities, especially with the rise of <br>
              many women taking up professions that were only believed to facilitate
               men.Those women end up being perceived as though they wouldn’t <br>
               possibly be able to do even half of the work men do in those professions 
               and that their place is at home taking care of the children and doing house <br>
                chores .
